# Module_4
Overview
In this project I have developed a Java program to demonstrate file read and write operations, as well as various language features such as variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, and classes. The program reads text from a file, allows the user to choose the case conversion (uppercase, lowercase, or no conversion) for the text, modifies the data accordingly, and writes the modified text to another file.

The purpose of writing this software is to enhance my skills as a software engineer and further my learning in the Java programming language. By implementing this project, I aimed to solidify my understanding of file handling, user input, and basic language constructs in Java.

To see a demonstration of the software running and a walkthrough of the code, you can watch the following YouTube video:

Development Environment
For the development of this software, I used the following tools:

Java Development Kit (JDK)
Operating System - Windows 10
The programming language used in this project is Java

Useful Websites
Oracle Java Documentation - https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/

Future Work
Error handling: Implement more robust error handling mechanisms to handle various exceptional cases, such as invalid file paths, permission issues, or unexpected input.
Input validation: Enhance the user input validation to handle cases where the user provides unexpected choices or invalid input types.
Expand functionality: Add more options for text modification, such as removing specific characters or applying custom transformations.
User interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to provide a more user-friendly and intuitive experience for selecting options and displaying results.
